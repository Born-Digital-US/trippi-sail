  <parameter name="autoFlushDormantSeconds"
             label="Seconds of buffer inactivity that will trigger an auto-flush.">
    <description>
      If this threshold is reached, flushing will occur in the background,
      during which time the buffer is still available for writing.
    </description>
  </parameter>
  <parameter name="autoFlushBufferSize" 
             label="The size at which the buffer should be auto-flushed.">
    <description>
      If this threshold is reached, flushing will occur in the background,
      during which time the buffer is still available for writing.
    </description>
  </parameter>
  <parameter name="bufferSafeCapacity"
             label="The maximum size the buffer can reach before being forcibly flushed.">
    <description>
      If this threshold is reached, flushing will occur in the foreground
      and the buffer will be locked for writing until it is finished.
      This should be larger than autoFlushBufferSize.

  </parameter>
  <parameter name="bufferFlushBatchSize"
             label="The number of updates to send to the triplestore at a time.">
    <description>
      This should be the same size as, or smaller than autoFlushBufferSize.
